   <h1>Vivid Sydney - Dichroic Dimensions</h1>
   <p>"Dichroic Dimensions" was an interactive public installation, using live vocals to drive building-scale projections and soundscapes</p>
   <p>Exhibited at Vivid Sydney 2014, Museum of Contemporary Art facade. Working with The Digital Shamans.</p>
   <p>I loved creating: the software to drive the interactive audio and visuals, using Max 6</p>
